<p>This is the course website for SOCIOL 880: Data Management (Spring 2019). This is a graduate mini-seminar (i.e. a half-semester course), and the companion to the <a href="https://socviz880.co">Data Visualization</a> mini taught in the second half of the semester. It provides an opinionated but undogmatic overview of tools and techniques you can use when doing quantitative or mixed-methods social science research. It does not teach you methods or statistics; instead it teaches you about the stuff that your methods and statistics instructors assume you already know about, and that you spend your time googling trying to find out how to fix. <a href="syllabus/">The syllabus</a>—really more of a speculative outline, because this is a first-time offering—has a little more detail.</p>
